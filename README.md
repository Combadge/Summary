# Summary
This Organisation is the home of @mo-g's Combadge Server, intended to let home users divert post-disposal Combadges away from the waste stream and into practical use for homes and hackerspaces.

The Combadge Server is hosted here: https://github.com/Combadge/Spindoctor

Hopefully you'll have a play with it! Now that code is released, this marker repo will be deleted after January 31st 2022.
